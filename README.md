# InnovativeTechDesign_Product_Shopping_Flow

# Summary
This is a prototype of a product shopping app that shows a product checkout experience. For this project I worked on incorporating micro-interactions and motion elements to enhance usability and engagement. 

# About
For this project, I designed a checkout experience using Figma to incorporate motion and micro-interactions that improve the user journey. I focused on refining the flow from product selection to checkout confirmation, ensuring fun transitions and visual feedback.

I implemented motion where the checkout button expands, providing a clear and engaging transition. Additionally, I animated opening a sheet to another product as well as a fun animation once the order has been placed. Subtle feedback loops guide users through the checkout process, reinforcing action completion and enhancing usability.

# Tools
  Figma – UI design and prototyping
  Github – Documentation and project submission
  Youtube - Lots of learniing and help!

Sorry - I fly through it so it fits in here!

# Reflection
This project challenged me to think beyond static screens and focus on creating a more interactive, engaging shopping experience. Learning how to integrate motion within a UX flow was both exciting and insightful. Initially, working with motion tools  was intimidating, but experimenting with different interaction techniques helped me understand their impact on usability.

Through this process, I improved my ability to design intuitive micro-interactions and gained a deeper appreciation for motion in UI design. These learnings will be invaluable as I continue developing my UX skill set, ensuring my future designs are not only functional but also fun to use. This was HARD - but I ended up having fun with it and am excited to see what else I can create!
